Below are the details of how we were able to create the program 
1. The following python libraries have to be installed : Huggingface, transformers, flask, datasets.
   Huggingface: This model was used to get the model card, which contains essential metadata about the chosen model
   Transformers: The transformers library was used to load and fine tune a pre trained model for NLP tasks.
   Google Collab: Was used to train the model, then it was downloaded locally, after which VS code was used to create the front end and connect it to the backend, Flask was used to build the API.


To run the code change the directory in the command line to the directory of the folder contaning the two .py file and the html template file. Two command lines would be needed,  in the first command line, run this command "python dynamic_trasnlations.py" and wait till it shows the localhost link to show first. In the second command line run this command "python flask_web_interface.py" and wait till it shows the localhost link then copy the link and paste it in a web browser.
Note: Ensure that all the three files are n the same location.
   
  Fiyin and King David were responsible for training the AI model that converts english to yoruba and ensured its accuracy and efficiency. Ite and Love designed and developed the frontend, creating a simple and user-friendly interface. John built the API using Flask, and enablied seamless communication between the frontend and backend. Meanwhile, David and Adeola worked on the README file, providing a simple and clear documentation to guide users on setup, usage, and project details.
